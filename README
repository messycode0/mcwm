mcwm - Messy Code Window Manager
--------------------------------

A lightweight DWM fork. Made for X.

Requirements
------------

To build mcwm, you need Xlib header files installed.

Installation
------------

In your shell:

    git clone https://github.com/messycode0/mcwm.git
    cd mcwm
    make
    sudo make install

To start mcwm, edit (or create) your ~/.xinitrc and add:

    exec mcwm

Then run `startx` to launch.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration of mcwm is done by editing the source code.

There are no Config.yaml files or bloated GUIs â€”
you make your changes in `config.h` and recompile like a boss.

Because real power users edit C.
